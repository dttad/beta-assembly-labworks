All my exercises for the chapter 13 - Instruction Sets: Addressing Modes and Formats in the subject CEA201 (Computer Organization and Architecture) in university
## Usage
Go to **[BSim Sanbox](https://computationstructures.org/exercises/sandboxes/bsim.html)** then click "*Open BSIM in a new window*".

## Threads
**1.** Interchange two parts from a[1] and a[3].

**2.** Write a program to do the calculation: a[0]=a[1]+a[2]

**3.** Divide a[0] by a[1], the integer part stored in a[2], the remaining part stored in a[3].

**4.** a[0] store the value of minutes. Convert the number of minutes to hour and store in a[1] and store the remaining one in a[2]. (For example: a[0] = 125, then a[1] = 2 and a[2] = 5).

**5.** a [0] store the value of seconds. Convert the number of minutes to hour and store in a[1] and store the remaining minutes in a[2] and the remaining seconds in a[3]. (For example: a[0] = 3745 then a[1] = 1 and a[2] = 2.

**6.** If a[1] > a[3], then interchange.

**7.** Find the minimum value of a[0], a[1] and a[2], the result is stored in a[3].

**8.** Find the maximum value of a[0], a[1] and a[2], the result is stored in a[3].

**9.** Check if a[0], a[1] and a[2] are the lengths of the triangle. If it is true, store 1 to a[3], otherwise store 0.

**10.** Sort a[0], a[1] and a[2] in ascending order.

**11.** Sort a[0], a[1] and a[2] in descending order.

**13.** Calculate the sum s = 1 + 2 + ... + a[0] and store it to register r0.

**14.** Calculate the total number of array elements from a[0] to a[9] and store it to a[10].

**15.** Find the largest number of array elements from a[0] to a[9] and store it to a[10].

**16.** Find the largest common divisor of a[0] and a[1] and store it to a[2].

**17.** Find the smallest common multiple of a[0] and a[1] and store it to a[2].

**18.** Determine if a[0] is prime number or not. If yes, write 1 to a[1], otherwise write 0.

**19.** Find the smallest prime number that is greater than a[0], the result is stored in a[1]. (For example, a[0]=8 then a[1]=11).

**20.** Determine if a[0] is a square number or not. If yes, write 1 to a[1], otherwise write 0.
